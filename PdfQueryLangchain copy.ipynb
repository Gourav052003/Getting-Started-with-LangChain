              "'IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE MOST BENEFICENT AND MERCIFUL\\nAs Salamo Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barkatahu,\\nI am thankful to Allah for giving me the opportunity to compile many of my favorite\\nMoral Stories, in the form of an electronic book, which I had collected from variousresources, since last few years. Even though many of these stories are fictional innature, but at the end they will give a great lesson to learn for a lifetime.\\nAs the reader can himself see from these stories, the subject “Moral” is universal to\\nevery human being. Hence these stories are not just for any particular sect or the followers of particular faith, it is for the entire humanity, irrespective of there belief,culture, race, color or age. So, let’s start with a Moral Story called as “ A POND FULL\\nOF MILK .”\\nOnce there was a king who told some of his workers to dig a pond. Once the pond was\\ndug, the king made an announcement to his people saying that one person from eachhousehold has to bring a glass of milk during the night and pour it into the pond. So,the pond should be full of milk by the morning. After receiving the order, everyonewent home.\\nOne man prepared to take the milk during the night. He thought that since everyone\\nwill bring milk, he could just hide a glass of water and pour inside the pond. Because itwill be dark at night, no one will notice. So he quickly went and poured the water in thepond and came back. In the morning, the king came to visit the pond and to his surprise the pond was only filled with water! What has happened is that everyone wasthinking like the other man that “I don\\'t have to put the milk, someone else will do it.”\\nDear friends, when it comes to help the Religion of Allah, do not think that others will\\ntake care of it. Rather, it starts from you, if you don’t do it, no one else will do it. So,change yourself to the way of Allah to serve Him and that will make the difference.\\nWith this I will end my little introduction and pray that\\nMay Almighty Allah accept it. So that we may all benefitfrom these stories.\\nWassalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmutallahi Wa BarkatahuAkramulla Syed\\nIslamic Occasions Networkhttp://www.islamicoccasions.com\\nDated: Sunday, March 20, 2005\\n100 Moral Stories                                                  1                                      www.islamicoccasions. com\\n001.

One day, he went for a trip to\\nsome distant areas of his country. When he was back to his palace, he complained that his feet werevery painful, because it was the first time that he went for such a long trip, and the road that hewent through was very rough and stony. He then ordered his people to cover every road of theentire country with leather.\\nDefinitely, this would need thousands of cows’ skin, and would cost a\\nhuge amount of money.\\nThen one of his wise servants dared himself to tell the king, “Why do\\nyou have to spend that unnecessary amount of money? Why don’t youjust cut a little piece of leather to cover your feet?”\\nThe king was surprised, but he later agreed to his suggestion, to make\\na “shoe” for himself.\\nThere is actually a valuable lesson of life in this story: to make this world a happy\\nplace to live, you better change yourself - your heart; and not the world.\\nTHE TRAVELERS AND THE PLANE TREE\\nTwo men were walking along one summer day. Soon itbecame too hot to go any further and, seeing a large plane tree nearby, they threw themselves on the ground to rest in its shade.\\nGazing up into the branches one man said to the other:\\n“What a useless tree this is. It does not have fruit or nuts that we can eat and we cannot even use its wood for anything.”\\n“Don’t be so ungrateful,” rustled the tree in reply. \\n“I am being extremely useful to you at this very moment, shielding you from the hot sun. And you call me a good-for-nothing!”\\nAll of God’s creations have a good purpose. \\nIslam teaches us that we should never belittle Allah’s blessings.\\nLEARN FROM MISTAKES\\nThomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a filament for the light bulb. When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant complained, “All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing.”\\nEdison replied very confidently, “Oh, we have come a long way and we have \\nlearned a lot. We now know that there are two thousand elements which we cannot use to make a good light bulb.”DON\\'T CHANGE THE WORLD\\n100 Moral Stories                                                  4                                      www.islamicoccasions. comOnce there was a shepherd boy who had to look after a flock of\\nsheep. One day, he felt bored and decided to play a trick on the villagers. He shouted, “Help! Wolf! Wolf!”\\nThe villagers heard his cries and rushed out of the village to help\\nthe shepherd boy. When they reached him, they asked, “Where is the wolf?”\\nThe shepherd boy laughed loudly, “Ha, Ha, Ha! I fooled all of you.\\nI was only playing a trick on you.”\\nA few days later, the shepherd boy played this trick again.Again he cried, “Help! Help! Wolf! Wolf!” Again, the villagers rushed up the hill to help him and\\nagain they found that boy had tricked them. They were very angry with him for being so naughty.\\nThen, some time later, a wolf went into the field. The wolf attacked one sheep, and then another\\nand another. The shepherd boy ran towards the village shouting, “Help! Help! Wolf! Help!Somebody!”\\nThe villagers heard his cries but they laughed because they thought it was another trick. The boy\\nran to the nearest villager and said, “A wolf is attacking the sheep. I lied before, but this time it istrue!”\\nFinally, the villagers went to look. It was true. They could see the wolf running away and many\\ndead sheep lying on the grass.\\nWe may not believe someone who often tells lies, even when he tells the truth.\\nTHE FARMER AND THE STORK\\nFinding that cranes were destroying his newly sown corn, a farmer \\none evening set a net in his field to catch the destructive birds. When he went to examine the net next morning he found a number of cranes and also a stork.\\n“Release me, I beseech you,” cried the stork, “for I have eaten none of\\nyour corn, nor have I done you any harm. I am a poor innocent stork,as you may see - a most dutiful bird, I honor my father and mother.I...”\\nBut the farmer cut him short. “All this may be true enough, I dare say,\\nbut I have caught you with those were destroying my crops, and youmust suffer with the company in which you are found.”\\nPeople are judged by the company they keep.THE BOY WHO CRIED \\'WOLF\\'\\n100 Moral Stories                                                  5                                      www.islamicoccasions. comA tortoise one day met a hare who made fun of her. \\n“My, my, you move so slowly, you will never get far!”\\nThe tortoises, upset by the hare’s manner, said, \\n“Let’s have a race and see who is faster.”\\nThe hare laughed and said, “You must be joking! But all right, we’ll\\nsee who reaches the other side of the hill first.” Off he ran, leavingthe tortoise far behind.\\nAfter a while, the hare stopped to wait for the tortoise to come long. \\nHe waited and waited till he felt sleepy. “I might as well take a nap,” he thought. “Even if she catches up with me, I can easily win therace.” So he lay down under a shady tree and closed his eyes.\\nWhen the tortoise passed the sleeping hare, she walked on slowly \\nbut steadily. By the time the hare woke up, the tortoise was near the finishing line. He ran as fast as he could, but he could not catchup with the tortoise.\\nSlow and steady can win the race.\\nTHE ANT AND THE DOVE\\nOne hot day, an ant was searching for some water.\\nAfter walking around for some time, she came to a spring.\\nTo reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass.\\nWhile making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water.\\nShe could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not\\nseen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quicklyplucked off a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.\\nJust at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his net\\ntowards the dove, hoping to trap it.\\nGuessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on\\nthe heel.

Now you can be a king!”\\nThe monkey asked, “How can I be a king?”As the dolphin started swimming away, he answered, “That is easy. As you are the only creature on\\nthis island, you will naturally be the king!”\\nThose who lie and boast may end up in trouble.\\nTHE FOX AND THE STORK\\nA selfish fox once invited a stork to dinner at his home in a hollow tree. That evening, the stork flew\\nto the fox’s home and knocked on the door with her long beak. The fox opened the door and said,“Please come in and share my food.”\\nThe stork was invited to sit down at the table. She was very hungry and the food smelled delicious!\\nThe fox served soup in shallow bowls and he licked up all his soup very quickly. However, the storkcould not have any of it as the bowl was too shallow for her long beak.

Yet, after all this time, I have not even budged that rockby half a millimeter. What is wrong? Why am I failing?”\\nThe Lord responded compassionately, “My Servant, when I asked you to serve Me and you \\naccepted, I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all of your strength, which youhave done. Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it. Your task was to push.And now you come to Me with your strength spent, thinking that you have failed. But, is that reallyso?

However bridge building experts throughout theworld thought that this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea. It just could notbe done. It was not practical. It had never been done before.\\nRoebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. He thought about it all the\\ntime and he knew deep in his heart that it could be done. He just had to share the dream withsomeone else. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington,an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built.\\nWorking together for the first time, the father and son developed concepts of how it could be\\naccomplished and how the obstacles could be overcome.

By moving this, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife.\\nHe touched his wife’s arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the \\nengineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do.It seemed foolish but the project was under way again.\\nFor 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife’s arm, until the\\nbridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as a tribute to the triumph of one man’s indomitable spirit and his determination not to be defeated bycircumstances. It is also a tribute to the engineers and their team work, and to their faith in a manwho was considered mad by half the world.

The pine tree explained that the birds gotwater from the cactus. “Does it not hurt when they make holes?” asked the rose.\\n“Yes, but the cactus does not like to see any birds suffer,” replied the pine.The rose opened its eyes in wonder and said, “The cactus has water?”“Yes you can also drink from it.

For this reason, the citizens of the village were angry and were not speaking toeach other. There was not even one garden which existed in the village where the children couldplay.

Now that I’m dying, will you follow me and keep mecompany?”\\n“No!” replied the 3rdwife. “Life is so good over here! I’m going to\\nremarry when you die!” The merchant’s heart sank and turned cold.\\nHe then asked the 2ndwife, “I always turned to you for help and\\nyou’ve always helped me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep\\nme company?” “I’m sorry, I can’t help you out this time!” replied the 2ndwife.” “At the very most, \\nI can only send you to your grave.” Answer came like a bolt of thunder & merchant was devastated.\\nThen a voice called out: “I’ll leave with you.

Drops of honey falling from it.\\nThe man wanted to taste one of the drops. So, he put his tongue out and tasted\\none of the fallen drops of honey. The honey was amazing in taste. So, he wanted to taste another drop. As he did, he got lost into the honey sweetness.\\nMeanwhile, he forgot about the two rats eating his branch away, the lion on\\nthe ground and the snake that is sitting right under him. After a while, hewoke up from his sleep.\\nTo get the meaning behind this dream, the man went to a pious scholar of\\nIslam. The scholar said, the lion you saw is your death. It always chases youand goes wherever you go.\\nThe two rats, one black and one white, are the night and the day. Black one is the night and the\\nwhite one is the day. They circle around, coming one after another, to eat your time as they takeyou closer to death. The big black snake with a dark mouth is your grave. It’s there, just waiting foryou to fall into it. The honeycomb is this world and the sweet honey is the luxuries of this world.We like to taste a drop of the luxuries of this world but it’s very sweet. Then we taste another dropand yet another.\\nMeanwhile, we get lost into it and we forget about our time, \\nwe forget about our death and we forget about our graves.\\n“This world is like a serpent, so soft to touch, but so full of lethal poison.

We don’t need toomuch, a roof over our heads and warm food to fill our tummy.

He said, “Your Majesty, \\nI believe that the servant has not been made part of The 99 Club.”\\n“The 99 Club? And what exactly is that?” the King inquired.To which the Assistant replied, “Your Majesty, to truly know what The 99 Club is, you will have to\\ndo the following... place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant’s doorstep, you will thenunderstand what The 99 Club is.”\\nThat very same evening, the King arranged for 99 Gold coins to be placed in a bag at the servant’s\\ndoorstep.

He promptly summoned his\\nassistant to his chambers. The King related his thoughts about the servant and once again, hisassistant listened.

But your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The 99\\nClub.” He explained: “The 99 Club is just a name given to those people who have everything but yet are never contented, therefore they are always working hard and striving for that extra one toround it out to 100!\\nWe have so much to be thankful for and we can live with very little in our lives, but the minute we\\nare given something bigger and better, we want even more!\\nWe are not the same happy contented person we used to be, we want more and more and by \\nwanting more and more we don’t realize the price we pay for it.

With great expertise and interest, he made such a nice and\\nbeautiful inkpot that it could be presented to the king. He expected that, appreciating his artisticskill, the king would encourage him as far as possible. So, with countless hopes and thousand ofdesires, he presented that inkpot to the king. In the beginning the king was very impressed by hisartistic skill but afterwards an unpleasant event occurred that caused an extraordinary change inSikaki’ s life and way of thinking.\\nWhen the king was observing the skilled artistry of the beautiful inkpot and Sikaki was lost in the\\nworld of thoughts, the people informed that a scholar-literary person or jury is about to enter thecourt. As soon as the scholar entered, the king got so much absorbed in welcoming and talking tohim that he forgot Sikaki and his skilled artistry. This incident caused an adverse and deep effecton the heart of Sikaki.\\nHe realized that now he would not receive the encouragement he had expected and all his desires\\nand hopes are useless now. But Sikaki’s high spirited mind did not allow him to be in peace, so hestarted thinking as to what should he do. He decided to do what the others have done and go on thesame way that the others have gone (uptill now). Therefore, he decided to search for his lost hopesin the world of knowledge, literature and books. Although for a wise man who has passed the daysof his young age, it was not easy to study with young children and to start right from the preliminary stage. But he did not have a choice . After all whenever the fish is taken out of water, it is fresh.\\nWorse than that, in the beginning he did not find any sort of interest in himself regarding reading\\nand writing. Perhaps spending a long time in artistic works and handicraft was the reason for stagnancy in his scientific and literary talent. But neither his advanced age nor lack of capability,none of these could change his decision. With great enthusiasm and zeal for attaining knowledge,he strictly got busy with his studies, until another incident occurred:\\nThe teacher who was teaching him Shafi’e jurisprudence (fiqh Shafi’e), taught him this lesson: \\n“The teacher believes that the skin of a dog becomes clean (tahir) after tanning.” Sikaki repeatedthis sentence a lot of times so that at the time of examination he should be able to succeed. Butwhen he was asked to answer this question, he said: “The dog believes that the skin of a teacherbecomes clean after tanning.”\\nThe audience upon hearing this answer started laughing. It was clear for everybody that this old\\nman is absolutely incapable of reading and writing. After this incident Sikaki not only left theschool , but he left the town and went towards the Jungle. By chance, he reached thefoot of a mountain, where he saw that the water is falling drop by drop from the topand due to the continuous falling of water, a hole had been formed in that hard stone.He reflected for sometime, a good idea crossed his mind like lightning. And he said:“Maybe my heart is not ready to accept (knowledge) but it is not harder than thisstone. It is impossible that continuous studying and hard work would be ineffective.”\\nTherefore, he came back and with hard work, he got busy in the attainment of \\nknowledge.

So the professor then picked\\nup a box of pebbles and poured them into the Jar. He shook the Jar lightly. The pebbles rolled intothe open areas between the golf balls.

He asked once more if the Jar was full. The students responded unanimous “yes.”\\nThe professor then produced two cups of Coffee from under the table and poured the entire \\ncontents into the Jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.\\n“Now,” said the professor, as the laughter subsided, “I want you to recognize that this Jar \\nrepresents your life. The golf balls are the important things, your God, family, your children, yourhealth, your friends, and your favorite passions things that if everything else was lost and only theyremained, your life would still be full.” The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job,your house, and your car. The sand is everything else the small stuff.\\n“If you put the sand into the Jar first,” he continued, “there is no room for the pebbles or the golf\\nballs.” The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you willnever have room for the things that are important. Pay attention to the things that are critical toyour happiness. Play with your children. Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.\\nOne of the students raised her hand and inquired what the Coffee represented. The professor\\nsmiled. “I’m glad you asked.

He wanted his sons to learn not to\\njudge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to goand look at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first sonwent in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, andthe youngest son in the fall.\\nWhen they had all gone and come back, he called them together to\\ndescribe what they had seen. The first son said that the tree was ugly,bent, and twisted. The second son said no it was covered with greenbuds and full of promise. The third son disagreed; he said it was laden with blossoms that smelledso sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen. The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.\\nThe man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but only\\none season in the tree’s life. He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only oneseason, and that the essence of who they are and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.\\nIf you give up when it’s winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your \\nsummer, fulfillment of your fall.

He saw the bud that would soon blossom, but noticed thornsupon the stem and he thought, “How can any beautiful flower come from aplant burdened with so many sharp thorns?” Saddened by this thought, he neglected to water the rose, and just before it was ready to bloom... it died. \\nSo it is with many people. Within every soul there is a rose. The good qualities planted in us at\\nbirth, grow amid the thorns of our faults. Many of us look at ourselves and see only the thorns, the defects.\\nWe despair, thinking that nothing good can possibly come from us. We neglect to water the good\\nwithin us, and eventually it dies. We never realize our potential. \\nSome people do not see the rose within themselves; someone else must show it to them. One of the\\ngreatest gifts a person can possess is to be able to reach past the thorns of another, and find therose within them.\\nThis is one of the characteristic of love... to look at a person, know their true faults and accepting\\nthat person into your life... all the while recognizing the nobility in their soul. Help others to realizethey can overcome their faults. If we show them the “rose” within themselves, they will conquertheir thorns. Only then will they blossom many times over.LESSONS ON LIFE\\nThe most favorable friend to me is that who shows me my flaws.

The people\\ndressed him up in expensive clothes and put him on an elephant and took him around the cities tosay goodbye to all the people.

After saying farewell, the people took the king with a boat to remote island and left him there.\\nOn their way back, they discovered a ship that had sunk just recently. They saw a young man who\\nsurvived by holding on to a floating piece of wood. As they needed a new king, they picked up theyoung man and took him to their country. They requested him to be a king for a year. First herefused but later he agreed to be a king. People told him about all the rules and regulations andthat how he will be sent to an island after one year.\\nAfter three days of being a king, he asked the ministers if they could show him the island where all\\nthe other kings were sent. They agreed and took him to the island. The island was covered withthick Jungles and sounds of vicious animals were heard coming out of them. The king went little bitinside to check. Soon he discovered the dead bodies of all the past kings. He understood that assoon as they were left in the island, the animals came and killed them.\\nThe king went back to the country and collected 100 strong workers.

The king then told the workers to plant gardens in various parts of the island.

Over the months,the island turned into a beautiful place.\\nThe young king would wear simple clothes and spend very little\\nfrom his earnings as a king. He sent all the earnings to the islandfor storage. When nine months passed like this, the king called theministers and told them: “I know that I have to go the island afterone year, but I would like to go there right now.” But the ministersdidn’t agree to this and said that he has to wait for another 3months to complete the year.\\n3 months passed and now it was a full year.

I have lived that life. While all the otherkings were lost into the luxuries of the kingdom, I always thought about the future and planned forit. I turned the deadly island into a beautiful abode for me where I can stay peacefully.”\\nThe moral lesson from this story is about how we should live our life. The life of this world is to\\nprepare for the life hereafter. In this life, we shouldn’t get lost into the deceiving and attractivethings of this world and forget about what is to come in the afterlife. Rather, even if we are kings,we should live a simple life like our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and save all our enjoyments for the hereafter. May Allah make it easy for us all.

The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but couldnot find it. Some said a bird might have stolen it. The king then asked them all to search for it andput a reward for $50,000 for anyone who found it.\\nOne day a clerk was walking home along a river next to an industrial area. This river was \\ncompletely polluted, filthy and smelly. As he was walking, the clerk saw a shimmering in the riverand when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it so that he couldget the $50,000 reward. He put his hand in the filthy, dirty river and grabbed at the necklace, butsome how missed it and didn\\'t catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklacewas still there. He tried again, this time he walked in the river and dirtied his pants in the filthyriver and put his whole arm in to catch the necklace. But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling depressed.\\nThen again he saw the necklace, right there. This time he was determined to get it, no matter what.\\nHe decided to plunge into the river, although it was a disgusting thing to do as the river was polluted, and his whole body would become filthy. He plunged in, and searched everywhere for thenecklace and yet he failed. This time he was really bewildered and came out feeling very depressedthat he could not get the necklace that would get him $50,000.\\nJust then a saint who was walking by, saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk \\ndidn\\'t want to share the secret with the saint, thinking the saint might take the necklace for himself,so he refused to tell the saint anything. But the saint could see this man was troubled and beingcompassionate, again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tellanyone about it. The clerk mustered some courage and decided to put some faith in the saint. Hetold the saint about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing. The saintthen told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, insteadof in the filthy river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was dangling on the branchof a tree. He had been trying to capture a mere reflection of the real necklace all this time.\\nMaterial happiness is just like the filthy, polluted river; because it is a mere reflection of the TRUE\\nhappiness in the spiritual world.\\nWe can never achieve the happiness we are looking for no matter how hard we endeavor in \\nmaterial life. Instead we should look upwards, toward God, who is the source of real happiness, andstop chasing after the reflection of this happiness in the material world. This spiritual happiness isthe only thing that can satisfy us completely.\\n“Happy is the man who always kept the \\nafterlife in his view, who remembers \\nthe Day of Reckoning through his deeds,\\nwho led a contented life and who was\\nhappy with the lot that Allah hath\\ndestined for him.” Imam Ali (AS)\\nAn elderly carpenter was ready to retire.

The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that his heart was not inhis work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunateway to end a dedicated career.\\nWhen the carpenter finished his work, his employer came to inspect\\nthe house. Then he handed the front-door key to the carpenter andsaid, \"This is your house... my gift to you.\"\\nThe carpenter was shocked!What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own house,\\nhe would have done it all so differently.\\nSo it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the \\nbuilding. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we have built. If we could do it over, we would do it much differently.\\nBut, you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or\\nerect a wall.

I used to wonder, “How in the world\\ncan Mother call them beautiful?” I am a logical, statistical man. I call thingsas I see them. I didn’t see beauty.\\nMy mother would tell people this with an enthusiasm they could feel. She \\nwas genuine. She wasn’t telling them they were beautiful to get somethingfrom them. Most of the time, they were trying to get something from her. I wondered for years what was wrong with Mother’s perception and vision.Couldn’t she see that all of the people she called beautiful weren’t beautiful?\\nYou were beautiful only if you had a certain figure and face that was classed as beautiful by the laws\\nof the world and glamour. Yet when my mother spoke, people smiled as though Glamour magazinehad listed them as one of the beautiful people of the year.\\nIt took me years to finally understand my mother’s vision and the phrase, “Beauty is in the eye of\\nthe beholder.” My mother had a spirit that could see the beauty in a person. Most only look on theoutside and then compare what they see with the standards the world has given them. That waswhat I was doing. Today when you leave your house, carefully look at the first person whom you see and notice how beautiful they are.\\nThey may be balding, fat, wrinkled, pimply, or any of the other things the world frowns upon as\\nbeauty. Look at them closely and look for the beauty. If you really look, you’ll see it.\\nI didn’t believe that at first until I tried it. Sure enough, as I stared and opened another set of eyes,\\nI was able to see the beauty in every person. No matter how rough or worn a person looked, eachpain etched line held a glimpse of beauty.\\nYou just had to look for the beauty. It’s there. When you leave your home this morning, look hard\\nat each person. You will start to see the beauty of every human who you didn’t know existed. Trustme and try this. If you sincerely look, you will see it. When you get home after seeing the beauty infaces you see, look in the mirror. You are beautiful. Thank you mama for all of the beauty that youhave not only seen, but added. She used to tell me: “Be like a honey bee which always sits on beautiful flowers.”\\nProphet Muhammad (SAW) said: “Indeed Allah is Beautiful and He loves beauty.” In other place \\nhe (SAW) says: “A believer is beautiful because Allah has given him beautiful characters.”\\nHoly Quran emphasizes on remembering the beautiful things Allah (SWT) has created and praise\\nthem profusely. “And as for the blessing of your Lord, do announce it.” (93:11)\\nAllah (SWT) Himself remembers and praises the good creations He has created; among them is His\\nbeloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW): “And He exalted your praise (O Muhammad).” (94:4)\\n“Indeed Allah and His Angels are sending blessings upon the Prophet. O you who believe, send\\nblessings upon him (you as well) and salute him with a (becoming) salutation.” (33:56)\\nDear readers, you are beautiful. May Allah’s beautiful blessings be upon you always.YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!\\n100 Moral Stories                                                72                                      www.islamicoccasions.c om\\nA man came out of his home to admire his new truck.\\nTo his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering \\ndents into the shiny paint of the truck.\\nThe man ran to his son, knocked him away, and hammered the little\\nboy’s hands into pulp as punishment.\\nWhen the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried \\ndesperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate fingers from boy’s both hands.\\nWhen the boy woke up from the surgery and saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said, “Daddy,\\nI’m sorry about your truck.” Then he asked, “But when are my fingers going to grow back?”\\nThe father went home and committed suicide.Think about this story the next time someone\\nsteps on your feet or you wish to take revenge.Think first before you lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be repaired. Brokenbones and hurt feelings often can’t.\\nToo often we fail to recognize the difference between the person and the performance.

Think before you act. Be patient. Forgive and forget. \\nLove one and all. \\nTHE FATHER AND HIS SONS\\nA father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and forthis purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks.\\nWhen they had done so, he placed the faggot into\\nthe hands of each of them in succession, andordered them to break it in pieces. They tried withall their strength, and were not able to do it. Henext opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, andagain put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke themeasily.\\nHe then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each\\nother, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.”\\nIn Union there is strength. Divided we fall; United we stand.BE PATIENT\\n100 Moral Stories                                                73                                      www.islamicoccasions.c om“One who cannot benefit by patience will die\\nof grief and excitement.” Imam Ali (AS)\\nNext autumn, when you see geese heading south for the winter, flying in a “V” formation, you\\nmight consider what science has discovered as to why they fly that way. As each bird flaps its wings,it creates uplift for the bird immediately following. By flying in a “V” formation, the whole flockadds at least 71 percent greater flying range than if each bird flew on its own.\\nPeople who share a common direction and sense of community can get\\nwhere they are going more quickly and easily, because they are travelingon the thrust of one another.\\nWhen a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and \\nresistance of trying to go it alone and quickly gets back into formation totake advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front. If we have thesense of a goose, we will stay in formation with those people who are heading the same way we are.\\nWhen the head goose gets tired, it rotates back in the wing and another goose flies point. \\nIt is sensible to take turns doing demanding jobs, whether with people or with geese flying south.\\nGeese honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed. \\nWhat message do we give when we honk from behind?\\nFinally - and this is important - when a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot, and falls out of\\nthe formation, two other geese fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly or until it dies; and only then dothey launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch up with their own group.\\nIf we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by each other like that.\\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE\\nMy friend was walking down a deserted Mexican beach at sunset. As he walked along, he began tosee another man in the distance. As he grew nearer, he noticed that the local native kept leaningdown, picking something up and throwing it out into the water. Time and again he kept hurlingthings out into the ocean. As my friend approached even closer, he noticed that the man was picking up starfish that had washed up on the beach, and, one at a time, he was throwing themback into the water. My friend was puzzled.\\nHe approached the man and said. “Good evening, friend. I was wondering what\\nyou are doing.”\\n“I’m throwing these starfish back into the ocean. You see its low tide right now\\nand all of these starfish have been washed up onto the shore. If I don’t throwthem back into the sea, they’ll die up here from lack of oxygen.”\\n“I understand,” my friend replied, “but there must be thousands of starfish on this beach. You can’t\\npossibly get to all of them. There are simply too many. And don’t you realize this is probably happening on hundreds of beaches all up and down this coast. Can’t you see that you can’t possiblymake a difference?”\\nThe local native smiled, bent down and picked up yet another starfish, and as he threw it back into\\nthe sea, he replied, “Made a difference to that one!”A SENSE OF A GOOSE\\n100 Moral Stories                                                74                                      www.islamicoccasions.c om\\n'"
